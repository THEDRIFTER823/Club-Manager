# Club-Manager
This code comes with several methods that help manage a club, 
accessing a data file with names, emails, phone numbers, addresses, membership rank and dates, fees, status and method of payment, hours committed, 
and whether or not a member is signed up for an upcoming event. 

The user accesses several methods in the terminal, and can use them to navigate the .csv file to obtain member information and broader club data.
